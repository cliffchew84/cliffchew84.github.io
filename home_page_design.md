- Why not add a timeline showcasing your learning journey?
- Add a skill section that shows your areas of expertise.
- Create a content management system so that you donâ€™t have to add all of the content/text shown on your website in the HTML template or your Python file. I created a PostgreSQL database on Heroku which is fed an Excel file with my content.
