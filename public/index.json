[{"content":"I am quite an avident reader, and I used to track my book readings on Goodreads. A notable \u0026ldquo;achievement\u0026rdquo; on my Goodreads was recording that I read 32 non-fiction books in a year, with notes. However, I have since stopped recording my readings on Goodreads, and this is me explaining my thought process for doing so.\nVanity metrics I read about the term \u0026ldquo;vanity metrics\u0026rdquo; from the book called Lean Analytics by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz. In a nutshell, vanity metrics looks at data about a company that actually does not provide much value to the company. For example, an increase in \u0026ldquo;number of page views\u0026rdquo; for an app may not indicate strong user growth because the page views could be from bots or casual users not making any purchases. Hence, \u0026ldquo;number of page views\u0026rdquo; is a vanity metric.\nI am bringing this up here because I realise \u0026ldquo;number of books read per year\u0026rdquo; was a vanity metric for me. Firstly, there are many different types of books (fiction and nonfiction) with different thickness. So reading ten light fiction books a month may not bring me more value than reading one really thick and dense book for work. Also, for books that I did not finish cover to cover, I should include them into my Goodreads too? And if I wanted to re-read some books, do I count them as additional book counts as well? In general, while I initially thought \u0026ldquo;number of books read per year\u0026rdquo; felt like a good way to monitor my learnings, it was distracting me from what I really wanted to achieve.\nDeeper intentions - Retention \u0026raquo; Acquisition Going deeper on the concept of vanity metric, I realise what I was doing was akin to spending marketing dollars on acquiring new customers without validating their retention on our platform. Reading books is one way to acquire knowledge, but what I need is to ensure that I acquire knowledge and skills to better my life. Unfortunately, I realise instances where I very quickly finished one book, only to jump straight into another book, without fully appreciating the previous book that I read. I was also struggling to retain the knowledge of books that I read, even when I slowed down on the speed.\nRetention -\u0026gt; Note Taking One early change I made was to start making notes. I did so by typing the paragraphs I want to capture into a central repository system on my laptop, so that I can review them in the future. This slowed down my readings, but I realised the extra time I took to take notes was better than me spending hours reading a book and forgetting everything after that. Some have suggested making notes by hand (Ryan Holiday does this), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a physical storage system of my notes. Saving my notes in softcopy in an online repository removes the fear of me losing my notes, and also allows me to more efficiently organise them. One thing I am exploring is how to better organise the learnings I have from different books to allow me to better retain the knowledge. But this is current still work in progress.\nBy taking notes and slowing myself down in my readings, I am actively reducing my focus on trying to read as many books as I can, and more intently reminding myself to focus more on immensing myself in the books that I am reading.\nRetention -\u0026gt; Practice Beyond taking notes to improve my knowledge retention, I learned that some of the knowledge that I gained requires me to spend time practicing them. Be it meditation, yoga, intermittent fasting, setting up that database server, these content requires me to actively apply them into my life. I do see similar concepts from the different books that I have read, which makes me feel that I know a topic better. Hence, rather than chasing to clear a certain number of books, I am trying to see how from each book, I am able to derive some actions that I can try or take to improve my life, or some concept from the book that I want to dwell more deeply after I put the book down. Reading about the benefits of meditation is helpful, but I also need to ensure I take time to start meditating.\nDiversifying content -\u0026gt; Beyond books Nowadays, there are a lot more ways to acquire knowledge, and the two I use more often these days are online courses, such as Coursea and Udemy, and YouTube podcasts like the \u0026ldquo;The First Million''. I know some people like audiobooks but I just can\u0026rsquo;t retain anything from audiobooks when I try. I am trying to see how I can capture notes from these mediums, but right now, I want to focus more on organising my notes and practice, before I capture more notes from these mediums.\nSo? I still read books, but I am mindful of the mindless chasing of numbers. I realise that my relentless need to read as many books as I can was getting me to forget what the true purpose of reading was, which was to actual knowledge to better my life.\nNow, when I do my readings, I try to focus on my learnings, note taking, and applications, and also expand to consuming and taking notes on podcasts. Lastly, I want to start to review and share my notes publicly now. Much like Marcus Aureliusâ€™ \u0026ldquo;Meditations\u0026rdquo;, I aim for these notes to be internal conversations with myself to review and refresh views and knowledge that I hold have come across. Making public is to give me some pressure to make more notes more coherent. Hopefully, the side effect of that is anyone who fumbles onto them may somehow find them useful.\n  .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/stop_goodreads/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am quite an avident reader, and I used to track my book readings on Goodreads.
