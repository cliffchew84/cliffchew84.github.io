[{"content":"My dance with uncertainty began in 2009, when I graduated from college into a weak job market that was still shaken by the Lehman Brothers collapse on September 15, 2008. All my career plans went out of the window, and I was in and out of a couple of jobs within my first five years of leaving college. It was laughable to think that I had any plan, as I kept changing my course of action every few months with new data and developments. It was only when I landed my data analyst role in a Singapore tech startup in 2019 that I finally felt my career was getting on track. Even so, I had to constantly adapt to changing developments in a field where new roles are constantly popping up, and where a career progression ladder is seen more as a guideline than a given route.\nIn my early career as a perpetual, disgraced job hopper, I used to envy people who had a dream career (doctor, lawyer, architect) from a young age that they grew up attaining by following a somewhat defined path set by their predescents. However, without this set path in my life, I learned how to think about decisions in a highly uncertain and information-starved environment.\nWhile this approach has served me well, I was also fortunate enough to fumble onto two books that substantiated my intuitions towards making decisions under uncertain conditions. These two books are “The Signal and the Noise” by Nate Silver and “Thinking In Bets” by Annie Duke. And rather than blowing my own trumpet here (I will shamelessly cover more personal examples and thought processes in another post), I would like to cover more about what I learned about uncertainty from these two books here.\nBook Summaries I read “The Signal and the Noise” a few years after my college graduation, and I was intrigued by how the author Nate Silver used data to make predictions on events like the US general elections. “Thinking in Bets”, on the other hand, is written by a professional poker player who used her skills in calculating odds on the gambling table to consult organisations on how they should make decisions about their unknown future. Two different professions, converging onto similar ideas that I learned to apply to my own life.\nAt the heart of these books is the idea that in life, we have to make decisions based on incomplete information. “The Signal and the Noise” touched lightly on the concept of Bayesian statistics. My intuition of Bayesian statistics is that we have base probabilities (a priori) on whether certain events will unfold, and when new information (data points) come in, we update these probabilities accordingly. Our actions or predictions should then be made from these probabilities.\n“The Signal and the Noise” covered a wide spectrum of topics relating to predictions, from economic forecasts, predicting earthquakes to interviewing a professional sports bettor. Most importantly, Nate’s many examples from these different fields that required making good predictions gave me a good mental framework on how to approach a life filled with uncertainty.\nIn “Thinking in Bets”, Annie compares life to the games of chess and poker. Rules and moves are fixed in chess, so the exact same moves played will lead to the exact same outcome. Poker, however, has an element of uncertainty because you do not know what cards will be dealt until the game ends. Hence, the same strategies in poker can lead to different outcomes when different cards are dealt. Annie also went deeper into the probabilistic thinking strategies that Annie learned as a professional poker player, and shared how probabilistic thinking can be applied outside of the poker game. Some of these strategies include stating explicitly the odds of how confident you are about a situation (I am 80% sure about this), preparing a pre-committed strategy before executing a plan, and having peers to review your strategies and blindspots.\nBook Learnings “The Signal and the Noise” got me to frame many key situations in my life as a set of hypotheses that I should test and validate with data points, and my actions will be based on my predictions of how these hypotheses will play out in the future. Should I do a PhD? Should I learn coding, and if so, what programming language should I learn? Am I cut out to be a programmer? Would a tech company hire me based on my current skill sets? These were some of the questions I hypothesised and tested while I navigated through my career and life since reading this book. Collecting more information and data about the situation at hand will help me better understand the validity of my hypotheses, as well as improve the confidence of the probability estimates that I have about the world around me. For example, being able to correctly assess my probabilities has given me confidence numerous times to know when to double down and when to take a different direction in my life. Ultimately, it is these hypotheses and probability estimates that affect the overall quality of my decisions, actions and life.\nA key concept “Thinking in Bets” highlighted in poker is called “resulting”, where a player judges the quality of his game decisions based on its outcomes. A poker player has to appreciate that even if he made all the right moves, he can still lose the hand due to plain bad luck. He can also win a hand due to pure good luck as well. “Resulting” reminds us to focus on the quality of our decisions, rather than spending too much time soaking in on our victories or mourning about our losses.\nAlso, unlike poker, I realise I can find ways to improve the odds of positive events in my life by managing my odds of receiving good luck. Such an approach also makes me appreciate that I can only make best bets on certain decisions and actions to take\nLastly, because my best efforts can still lead to undesirable outcomes, I learn to redefine what people commonly define as failures to be more like learning opportunities to understand how I was off about my probability estimates. Such a mental model helps at times to reduce the anguish of seeing myself as a failure, and helps me more to rationally assess how I can improve the quality of my decision making in the long run. On a separate note, I also find Stoic philosophy helpful when dealing with negative emotions from dealing with undesirable outcomes, but I these will be topics that I like to cover in a separate, future post.\nPersonal experiences As I want this post to focus on reviewing these two books, I will post more in a separate post about my thought process in thinking about my career in the midst of great uncertainty, what steps I took to increase the information (reduce the uncertainty) I had about myself and my aspired career, and how everything eventually led me to become a freelance data analyst, ten years down the road.\nTo end this post, I want to share snippets from both books that I really resonated with. These two books definitely touched on more than what I can share in this single post, so I highly recommend everyone interested to read these two books to glean insights from them directly.\n  .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/uncertainty/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy dance with uncertainty began in 2009, when I graduated from college into a weak job market that was still shaken by the Lehman Brothers collapse on September 15, 2008.

Don’t try to give an exact number, but one that is linked to a probability of reaching a certain outcome. Using historical data that matches with the current situation. However, be careful to investigate if the current situation has ever occurred, before we can consider whether the data applies to the current situation. Hippocratic oath. Primum non nocere: First, do no harm. As statistician George E. P. Box wrote, “All models are wrong, but some models are useful” - All models are simplifications of the universe. A good model can be useful even when it fails. \u0026ldquo;It should be given that whatever forecast we make on average will be wrong. So usually it’s about understanding how it’s wrong, and what to do when it’s wrong, and minimising the cost to us when it’s wrong.\u0026rdquo; The key is in remembering that a model is a tool to help us understand the complexities of the universe, and never a substitute for the universe itself. In many cases involving predictions about human activity, the very act of prediction can alter the way that people behave. \u0026hellip; A case where predictions can bring itself about is called self-fulfilling prediction or self-fulfilling prophecy. A different prediction-influencer are self-cancelling predictions. An example is GPS navigation systems that advise drivers on the least congested route, but only to direct all drivers to that particular route and jam it up. Chess might be thought of as analogous to prediction. The players must process information - the position of the thirty-two pieces on the board and their possible moves. They use this information to devise strategies to place their opponent in checkmate. These strategies in essence represent different hypotheses about how to win the game. Whoever succeeds in that task had the better hypothesis. Sports betting: Voulgaris’ big secret is that he has thousands of little secrets, quanta of information that he puts together one vector at a time. To most people, the sort of things that Voulgaris observes might seem trivial. The big and obvious edges will have been noticed by other gamblers anyway, and will be reflected in the betting line. So he needs to dig a little deeper.    .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/book_signal_noise/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnfortunately, I didn’t record the exact pages was taking for this book\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Book Review of The Signal and the Noise"},{"content":"Paragraphs from the books\n7 - Pete Carroll was a victim of our tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome. Poker players have a word for this: \u0026ldquo;resulting\u0026rdquo;. When I started playing poker, more experienced players warned me about the dangers of resulting, cautioning me to resist the temptation to change my strategy just because a few hands didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out well in the short run.\n21 - Chess contains no hidden information and very little luck. The pieces are all there for other players to see\u0026hellip; Chess, for all its strategic complexity, isn\u0026rsquo;t a great model for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve hidden information and a much greater influence of luck\u0026hellip; Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. Valuable information remains hidden. There is also an element of luck in any outcome.\n26 - Getting comfortable with \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure\u0026rdquo; is a vital step to being a better decision-maker. We have to make peace with not knowing.\n27 - What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.\u0026rdquo;\n33 - Decisions are bets on the future, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; based on whether they turn out well on any particular iteration. An unwanted result doesn\u0026rsquo;t make our decision wrong if we thought about the alternatives and probabilities in advance and allocated our resources accordingly\u0026hellip;\n35 - First, the world is a pretty random place. The influence of luck makes it impossible to predict exactly how things will turn out, and all the hidden information makes it even worse. If we don\u0026rsquo;t change our mindset, we are going to have a deal with being wrong a lot. It\u0026rsquo;s built into the equation.\n48 - Part of the skill in life comes from learning to be a better calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update our beliefs to more accurately represent the world. The more accurate our beliefs, the better the foundation of the bets we make. There is also skill in identifying when our thinking patterns might lead us astray, no matter what our beliefs are, and in developing strategies to work with.\n65 - When someone challenges us to bet on a belief, signalling their confidence that our belief is inaccurate in some way, ideally it triggers us to vet the belief, taking an inventory of the evidence that informed us:\n How do I know this? Where did I get this information? What is the quality of my sources? How much do I trust them? How up to date is my information? How much information do I have that is relevant to the belief? What other things like this have I been confident about that turned out not to be true? What are the other plausible alternatives? What do I know about the persona challenging my belief? What do they know that I don\u0026rsquo;t know? What is their level of expertise? What am I missing?  70 - Incorporating uncertainty into the way we think about our beliefs comes with many benefits. By expressing our level of confidence in what we believe, we are shifting our approach to how we view the world. Acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it. Incorporating uncertainty in the way we think about what we believe creates open-mindedness, moving us closer to a more objective stance towards information.\nDeclaring our uncertainty in our beliefs to others makes us more credible communicators. We assume that if we don\u0026rsquo;t come off as 100% confident, others will value our opinions less. The opposite is usually true.\n80 - We have the opportunity to learn from the way the future unfolds to improve our beliefs and decisions going forward. The more evidence we get from experience, the less uncertainty we have about our beliefs and choices. Actively using outcomes to examine our beliefs and bets closes the feedback loop, reducing uncertainty.\nIdeally, our beliefs and our bets improve with time as we learn from experiences. Ideally, the more information we have, the better we get at making decisions about which possible future to bet on. Ideally, as we learn from experience we get better at assessing the likelihood of a particular outcome given any decision, making our predictions about the future more accurate.\n110 - When I admit mistakes, when I recognised the luck element in my successes, when I gave other players credit for making some good decisions, when I was eager to share a hand that I thought I played poorly because I might learn something from it, that chorus reminded me that what I was doing was hard, and that others weren\u0026rsquo;t often doing it. Identifying learning opportunities that other players were missing made me feel good about myself, reinforcing my routine change.\n113 - Once we start actively training ourselves in testing alternative hypotheses and perspective taking, it becomes clear that outcomes are rarely 100% luck or 100% skill. This means that when new information comes in, we have options beyond unquestioned confirmation or reversal. We can modify our beliefs along a spectrum because we know it is a spectrum, not a choice between opposites without middle ground.\n172 to 174 -\n First, express uncertainty. Uncertainty not only improves truth seeking within groups but also invites everyone around us to share helpful information and dissenting opinions. Second, lead with assent. For example, listen for the things you agree with, state those and be specific, and then follow with \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;but\u0026rdquo;. Third, ask for a temporary agreement to engage in truth seeking. If someone is off-loading emotion to us, we can ask them if they are just looking to vent or if they are looking for advice. Finally, focus on the future.  209 - For us to make better decisions, we need to perform reconnaissance in the future. If a decision is a bet on a particular future based on our beliefs, then before we place a bet we should consider in detail what those possible futures might look like. Any decision can result in a set of possible outcomes.\nThinking about what futures are contained in that set (which we do by putting memories together in a novel way to imagine how things might turn out) helps us figure out which decisions to make.\n209 - The reason why we do reconnaissance is because we are uncertain. We don\u0026rsquo;t (and likely can\u0026rsquo;t) know how often things will turn out a certain way with exact precision\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s about acknowledging that we are already making a prediction off if we make that explicit.\n  .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/book_thinking_in_bets/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eParagraphs from the books\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Book Review of Thinking In Bets"},{"content":"I am quite an avident reader, and I used to track my book readings on Goodreads. A notable \u0026ldquo;achievement\u0026rdquo; on my Goodreads was recording that I read 32 non-fiction books in a year, with notes. However, I have since stopped recording my readings on Goodreads, and this is me explaining my thought process for doing so.\nVanity metrics I read about the term \u0026ldquo;vanity metrics\u0026rdquo; from the book called Lean Analytics by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz. In a nutshell, vanity metrics looks at data about a company that actually does not provide much value to the company. For example, an increase in \u0026ldquo;number of page views\u0026rdquo; for an app may not indicate strong user growth because the page views could be from bots or casual users not making any purchases. Hence, \u0026ldquo;number of page views\u0026rdquo; is a vanity metric.\nI am bringing this up here because I realise \u0026ldquo;number of books read per year\u0026rdquo; was a vanity metric for me. Firstly, there are many different types of books (fiction and nonfiction) with different thickness. So reading ten light fiction books a month may not bring me more value than reading one really thick and dense book for work. Also, for books that I did not finish cover to cover, I should include them into my Goodreads too? And if I wanted to re-read some books, do I count them as additional book counts as well? In general, while I initially thought \u0026ldquo;number of books read per year\u0026rdquo; felt like a good way to monitor my learnings, it was distracting me from what I really wanted to achieve.\nDeeper intentions - Retention \u0026raquo; Acquisition Going deeper on the concept of vanity metric, I realise what I was doing was akin to spending marketing dollars on acquiring new customers without validating their retention on our platform. Reading books is one way to acquire knowledge, but what I need is to ensure that I acquire knowledge and skills to better my life. Unfortunately, I realise instances where I very quickly finished one book, only to jump straight into another book, without fully appreciating the previous book that I read. I was also struggling to retain the knowledge of books that I read, even when I slowed down on the speed.\nRetention -\u0026gt; Note Taking One early change I made was to start making notes. I did so by typing the paragraphs I want to capture into a central repository system on my laptop, so that I can review them in the future. This slowed down my readings, but I realised the extra time I took to take notes was better than me spending hours reading a book and forgetting everything after that. Some have suggested making notes by hand (Ryan Holiday does this), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a physical storage system of my notes. Saving my notes in softcopy in an online repository removes the fear of me losing my notes, and also allows me to more efficiently organise them. One thing I am exploring is how to better organise the learnings I have from different books to allow me to better retain the knowledge. But this is current still work in progress.\nBy taking notes and slowing myself down in my readings, I am actively reducing my focus on trying to read as many books as I can, and more intently reminding myself to focus more on immensing myself in the books that I am reading.\nRetention -\u0026gt; Practice Beyond taking notes to improve my knowledge retention, I learned that some of the knowledge that I gained requires me to spend time practicing them. Be it meditation, yoga, intermittent fasting, setting up that database server, these content requires me to actively apply them into my life. I do see similar concepts from the different books that I have read, which makes me feel that I know a topic better. Hence, rather than chasing to clear a certain number of books, I am trying to see how from each book, I am able to derive some actions that I can try or take to improve my life, or some concept from the book that I want to dwell more deeply after I put the book down. Reading about the benefits of meditation is helpful, but I also need to ensure I take time to start meditating.\nDiversifying content -\u0026gt; Beyond books Nowadays, there are a lot more ways to acquire knowledge, and the two I use more often these days are online courses, such as Coursea and Udemy, and YouTube podcasts like the \u0026ldquo;The First Million''. I know some people like audiobooks but I just can\u0026rsquo;t retain anything from audiobooks when I try. I am trying to see how I can capture notes from these mediums, but right now, I want to focus more on organising my notes and practice, before I capture more notes from these mediums.\nSo? I still read books, but I am mindful of the mindless chasing of numbers. I realise that my relentless need to read as many books as I can was getting me to forget what the true purpose of reading was, which was to actual knowledge to better my life.\nNow, when I do my readings, I try to focus on my learnings, note taking, and applications, and also expand to consuming and taking notes on podcasts. Lastly, I want to start to review and share my notes publicly now. Much like Marcus Aurelius’ \u0026ldquo;Meditations\u0026rdquo;, I aim for these notes to be internal conversations with myself to review and refresh views and knowledge that I hold have come across. Making public is to give me some pressure to make more notes more coherent. Hopefully, the side effect of that is anyone who fumbles onto them may somehow find them useful.\n  .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/stop_goodreads/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am quite an avident reader, and I used to track my book readings on Goodreads.
