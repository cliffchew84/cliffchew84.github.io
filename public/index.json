[{"content":"In 2011, I started creating digital notes of books that I read with the aim of creating a knowledge repository.\nDuring this time, I consumed topics in philosophy, economics, entrepreneurship, self-help, programming, tech and digital marketing, just to name a few.\nAnd after more than a decade of creating my notes, I want a space to publicly share my learnings from these books. In particular, I hope to be able to combine knowledge from different books and fields to form my own unique perspectives as well.\nIn addition, with the advent of YouTube and podcasts in the past few years, I am also thinking of reviewing some interesting YouTube \u0026amp; podcasts, and centering around topics on philosophy and entrepreneurship.\nI believe in setting experiments and this space is definitely one of them. Hoping to share some useful content that I felt I personally benefited from.\n  .emojify { font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; font-size: 2rem; vertical-align: middle; } @media screen and (max-width:650px) { .nowrap { display: block; margin: 25px 0; } } ","permalink":"https://cliffchew84.github.io/public/posts/direction/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, I started creating digital notes of books that I read with the aim of creating a knowledge repository.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Direction"}]
