  "articleBody": "My dance with uncertainty began in 2009, when I graduated from college into a weak job market that was still shaken by the Lehman Brothers collapse on September 15, 2008. All my career plans went out of the window, and I was in and out of a couple of jobs within my first five years of leaving college. It was laughable to think that I had any plan, as I kept changing my course of action every few months with new data and developments. It was only when I landed my data analyst role in a Singapore tech startup in 2019 that I finally felt my career was getting on track. Even so, I had to constantly adapt to changing developments in a field where new roles are constantly popping up, and where a career progression ladder is seen more as a guideline than a given route.\nIn my early career as a perpetual, disgraced job hopper, I used to envy people who had a dream career (doctor, lawyer, architect) from a young age that they grew up attaining by following a somewhat defined path set by their predescents. However, without this set path in my life, I learned how to think about decisions in a highly uncertain and information-starved environment.\nWhile this approach has served me well, I was also fortunate enough to fumble onto two books that substantiated my intuitions towards making decisions under uncertain conditions. These two books are “The Signal and the Noise” by Nate Silver and “Thinking In Bets” by Annie Duke. And rather than blowing my own trumpet here (I will shamelessly cover more personal examples and thought processes in another post), I would like to cover more about what I learned about uncertainty from these two books here.\nBook Summaries I read “The Signal and the Noise” a few years after my college graduation, and I was intrigued by how the author Nate Silver used data to make predictions on events like the US general elections. “Thinking in Bets”, on the other hand, is written by a professional poker player who used her skills in calculating odds on the gambling table to consult organisations on how they should make decisions about their unknown future. Two different professions, converging onto similar ideas that I learned to apply to my own life.\nAt the heart of these books is the idea that in life, we have to make decisions based on incomplete information. “The Signal and the Noise” touched lightly on the concept of Bayesian statistics. My intuition of Bayesian statistics is that we have base probabilities (a priori) on whether certain events will unfold, and when new information (data points) come in, we update these probabilities accordingly. Our actions or predictions should then be made from these probabilities.\n“The Signal and the Noise” covered a wide spectrum of topics relating to predictions, from economic forecasts, predicting earthquakes to interviewing a professional sports bettor. Most importantly, Nate’s many examples from these different fields that required making good predictions gave me a good mental framework on how to approach a life filled with uncertainty.\nIn “Thinking in Bets”, Annie compares life to the games of chess and poker. Rules and moves are fixed in chess, so the exact same moves played will lead to the exact same outcome. Poker, however, has an element of uncertainty because you do not know what cards will be dealt until the game ends. Hence, the same strategies in poker can lead to different outcomes when different cards are dealt. Annie also went deeper into the probabilistic thinking strategies that Annie learned as a professional poker player, and shared how probabilistic thinking can be applied outside of the poker game. Some of these strategies include stating explicitly the odds of how confident you are about a situation (I am 80% sure about this), preparing a pre-committed strategy before executing a plan, and having peers to review your strategies and blindspots.\nBook Learnings “The Signal and the Noise” got me to frame many key situations in my life as a set of hypotheses that I should test and validate with data points, and my actions will be based on my predictions of how these hypotheses will play out in the future. Should I do a PhD? Should I learn coding, and if so, what programming language should I learn? Am I cut out to be a programmer? Would a tech company hire me based on my current skill sets? These were some of the questions I hypothesised and tested while I navigated through my career and life since reading this book. Collecting more information and data about the situation at hand will help me better understand the validity of my hypotheses, as well as improve the confidence of the probability estimates that I have about the world around me. For example, being able to correctly assess my probabilities has given me confidence numerous times to know when to double down and when to take a different direction in my life. Ultimately, it is these hypotheses and probability estimates that affect the overall quality of my decisions, actions and life.\nA key concept “Thinking in Bets” highlighted in poker is called “resulting”, where a player judges the quality of his game decisions based on its outcomes. A poker player has to appreciate that even if he made all the right moves, he can still lose the hand due to plain bad luck. He can also win a hand due to pure good luck as well. “Resulting” reminds us to focus on the quality of our decisions, rather than spending too much time soaking in on our victories or mourning about our losses.\nAlso, unlike poker, I realise I can find ways to improve the odds of positive events in my life by managing my odds of receiving good luck. Such an approach also makes me appreciate that I can only make best bets on certain decisions and actions to take\nLastly, because my best efforts can still lead to undesirable outcomes, I learn to redefine what people commonly define as failures to be more like learning opportunities to understand how I was off about my probability estimates. Such a mental model helps at times to reduce the anguish of seeing myself as a failure, and helps me more to rationally assess how I can improve the quality of my decision making in the long run. On a separate note, I also find Stoic philosophy helpful when dealing with negative emotions from dealing with undesirable outcomes, but I these will be topics that I like to cover in a separate, future post.\nPersonal experiences As I want this post to focus on reviewing these two books, I will post more in a separate post about my thought process in thinking about my career in the midst of great uncertainty, what steps I took to increase the information (reduce the uncertainty) I had about myself and my aspired career, and how everything eventually led me to become a freelance data analyst, ten years down the road.\nTo end this post, I want to share snippets from both books that I really resonated with.
